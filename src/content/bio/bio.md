My goal as an artist is to create a story or to elicit a feeling from the viewer of my work. I received formal training in sculpting by Robert Cunningham, one of the Getty Museum's first artists in residence, and learned painting and drawing techniques from online artists including Will Kemp, Anne Packard, Oliver Sin, Kim Lordier, Susan Lyon, Carol Marine, Jeremy Lipking, Brian Ryder and many others and I'm deeply indebted to all of them.

I love doing portraits with charcoal, and look forward to expanding into oils. I also enjoy painting landscapes in oil, using the wet on wet (alla prima) technique. I usually take a photo of the subject and work in my studio at home, next to my husband's studio. He is a prize-winning music composer from Argentina, who's composed 85 scores (at last count).

We're both very grateful and blessed to be living the life of our dreams here in Calabasas, California, in a quiet, beautiful community with a bunch of really wonderful neighbors and friends.
