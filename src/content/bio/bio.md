My goal as an artist is to create beautiful, peaceful images. I took sculpting lessons from Robert Cunningham, a gifted sculptor who was one of Getty Museum's first artists in residence. Painting and drawing techniques come from online artists Will Kemp, Anne Packard, Oliver Sin, Kim Lordier, Susan Lyon, Carol Marine, Jeremy Lipking, Brian Ryder and many others, to whom I'm deeply indebted.

I work in my studio at home, next to my husband's studio. Emilio is a multiple award-winning music composer from Argentina, who's composed 85 film/television scores.Together we have four children and four grandkids.

We both are grateful and blessed to be living the life of our dreams here in Calabasas, California, in a quiet, beautiful community with a bunch of really wonderful neighbors and friends.
