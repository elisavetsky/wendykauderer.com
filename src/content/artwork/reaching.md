Hands are harder to do than Iâ€™d anticipated, and this kept me busy and challenged. Every joint, how the skin falls, the veins, nails, all has to be defined and everything is revelatory of the subject. A hand can be young, old, wrinkled, male, female, weak, strong, or as in this case, more than anything else, imploring. Pencil and white charcoal.
