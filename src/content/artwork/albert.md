I’ve been trying to achieve likeness for a while, and though I did with this, it’s still a little raw. That may be a good thing, I’m not sure. What I loved about Schweitzer is that he was a brilliant, seemingly emotionally intelligent man, which made it easy for me to choose him as a subject. Drawing is easier to control than painting. If I make a mistake, I can erase it or start over easily, because I’m just wasting lead instead of paint and/or a canvas. I’ve been drawing for a lot longer than painting, so it’s also a much more comfortable medium for me.
