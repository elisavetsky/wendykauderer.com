This was done 15 years ago. It’s not one of my favorites. I keep drawings partially because my husband thinks they’re worth saving, and in his defense, it’s a good practice because I can track my progress.  This is a pastel quick sketch, and I was dying to do color, but I am underwhelmed by what I chose here. Since I’m doing art for my own pleasure, I don’t enjoy the pressure of doing a quick sketch all that much. That said, I know it’s helpful to loosen up and enjoy/push through the process of quick gesture drawings. I should do more of those, because there’s no doubt my art would be better and have more vida if I do.
