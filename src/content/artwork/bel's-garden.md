From a the cover of a magazine provided to me by my friend, Belinda, of the garden of her home in the outskirts of Johannesburg, South Africa. It was important for me to do some kind of rendering that would bring her back to that place she’d created, and though I tend not to like a tightly wound painting, I didn’t want to get too loose with my interpretation of the photo she’d sent me. This is what I ended up with.
