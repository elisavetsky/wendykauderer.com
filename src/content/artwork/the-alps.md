2019, oil. From a photo in the LA Times. These mountains are located in Romania, and though I’ve never been there, it’s on my bucket list.. These little houses, photographed on a spring day in a tiny village below grass-covered rolling hills - - and the almost-gone snow on the mountains…it’s what fairy tales are made of.
