This was done towards the end of my sculpting lessons with Bob Cunningham. It's a plaster piece. Bob instructed us not only in sculpting, but in mold-making, a process which I found to be difficult and tedious. I could have taken my pieces to a foundry, but at the time, that was too much of an expense.
