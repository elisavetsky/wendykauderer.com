2018, A color exercise. My beginning efforts at painting involved either trying to match the colors or the images in front me. I wanted to see if I could see. I found that though I couldn’t replicate my source material, I was able to interpret it in a different way - - in my way.

In an article I read from the website FASO, I learned that art isn’t just about seeing, it’s about creativity. If it’s a happy accident, great. If I’ve done something I can’t live with, that’s ok, too. It’s about practicing, enjoying practicing, experimenting and for me, feeling how glorious it is to do what I love.
