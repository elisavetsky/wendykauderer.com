I loved this technique, which allowed me to explore emergence. It’s as if she’s coming from some other world. She’s anything but determined or feisty. She’s dreamy, almost frothy, not well-defined, but definitely a presence. This became an exercise in sublety for me.  I didn’t want to blow the mood of the piece by defining a lot, but I needed enough definition to be descriptive.
