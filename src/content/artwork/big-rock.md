2018, from a photo of a beach scene. I was trying to convey the feeling of how the wave moves, how light affects its color and the spray as it crashes against the rock. A lot of what I learned I got from looking at youtube videos, and when I started doing this in late 2017, Carol Marine’s approach was incredibly helpful. Working with acrylics is challenging for me, because unlike oils, they dry really fast. I could never get really used to painting one color and having it end up being a different color entirely. I ended up switching to oils not long after I did this…even though this is one of my better acrylic efforts.
