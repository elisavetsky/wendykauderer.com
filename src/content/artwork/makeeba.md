I loved this subject. I like what I was able to achieve in terms of her smile, the color of her skin, and the joy she radiates. I like doing people of color, especially black people, because I’m attracted to the voluptuousness of the lips and nose. I’m attracted to beauty generally and I think this woman is stunning. The medium is colored pencils.
