When Emilio and our dog Annie went there for a quick getaway for the day. Being in the mountains, pines circling the lake, a sunny day, blue skies, husband and dogâ€¦heaven!! This was my first try at reflected water, and it ended up being pretty basic, but I was satisfied that it got the idea across. I ended up liking all the different colors and shadows that I was able to convey from the photo we took of that day.
