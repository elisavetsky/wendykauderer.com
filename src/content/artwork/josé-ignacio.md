2018, oil on wood. I loved this place, Jose Ignacio in Uruquay. No people for miles, the sounds of nature. This is taken from my photos and memories of a river near a place I stayed with Emilio. It felt like we were the only people in the entire place…always a beautiful feeling for me. This painting is on a wood board, which feels very different from painting on a canvas. There’s less resistance with the brush…and like the river, everything flows.
