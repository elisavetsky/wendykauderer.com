This is one of the first paintings I did after having left drawing and sculpture behind for many years.

I liked what happened here with a palette knife. It would cover the other colors I’d put down, but not entirely, so a texture was created. I was a little too invested in the outcome of this painting, because I didn’t want to fail.

So I just kept playing around with colors and ideas, and all of a sudden, it was time to stop. In doing art, I’ve had great difficulty being able to tell when I should stop, when the result was something I could live with - - or even like! After doing art for the last couple of years, I think I’m getting better at that because it’s become easier to be less precious about what I’m doing.

That allows me to enjoy the process a lot more. I feel less attached to the outcome, and freer in doing it.
