I allowed myself to get really loose with this painting, and used a large brush on the fabric. I didn’t pay a lot of attention to straight lines, and instead concentrated on shadow and color. A thin blue line running down the side of the vase along with other highlighting techniques and colors created shadows and illumination that helped me to like this one.
